Problem description
-------------------

Matthew is a collector of books, comics, magazines. However, as his collection has become difficult to manage over the years, he would like to have an efficient way to index and find books and other items in his collection.

Each item has a title, author, a unique code (ISBN/ISSN), publishing year, rating, and type. The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a 13 digit number for books, and the ISSN is a unique eight-digit number used to identify a magazines. A rating is either excellent, good, average, poor or unknown.

He wants to be able to get an overview of his collection for each type and sort items by author or title. Items can be added, removed. Editing existing items is not supported, as it is unlikely to occur.
